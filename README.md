# Benchmarking the GPU for the Roofline Plot ridges

A benchmark set to measure the NVIDIA GPU F32 perfmance and DRAM/L1/L2 bandwidth.

This repo is forked from [a benchmarking set for Volta](https://github.com/shen203/GPU_Microbenchmark).
Some of the parameters are modified based on the hardware difference.
